	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures the time an algorithm takes to run as a function of input size. Efficient algorithms minimize time complexity, allowing faster execution.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> measures the memory an algorithm uses relative to input size. It is expressed in Big O notation, such as O(n), indicating linear growth. Efficient algorithms minimize space complexity, which is crucial in memory-constrained environments. Understanding space complexity aids in optimizing memory usage for better performance.</p>
